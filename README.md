# E-Commerce_Website
This was supposed to be a copy of a 2nd year university group project in which my group made a e-commerce site for "selling" cars.
I never managed to get a working copy of the final code from my group mates so what is in this repo is all I have to show.
The final product had a homepage with a nav bar and search bar and login/signup functionality connected to a MongoDB database
It also had a carousel of products related to ones you had already purchased. (which is a little odd for a car dealership but it was required for the project)
Users could sign up for an account and use said account to search for and put cars in their basket and then "buy" them. No payment system was implemented, no money was taken and no cars were ever intended to be shipped as this was just a university project

It also had a content management system for employees to traverse the database and add, update or delete existing entries

PHP was used to allow for modular code.
